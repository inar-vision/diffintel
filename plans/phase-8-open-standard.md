# Phase 8 — Open Standard & Ecosystem

> **Status**: Future — can start partially alongside Phase 5 (publishing the GitHub Action), but ecosystem growth depends on adoption.

## Goal

Establish the intent specification as a recognized standard that others adopt and build tooling around, independent of this implementation.

## Key Areas

- **Formal spec** — versioned specification document with changelog and rationale
- **JSON Schema on Schema Store** — IDE autocompletion for intent.json
- **GitHub Action on Marketplace** — published from Phase 5 work
- **VS Code extension** — inline intent status, undeclared route warnings
- **Community analyzer plugins** — registry for third-party analyzers
- **CI templates** — GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, CircleCI
- **Example intent files** — common patterns (REST, GraphQL, microservices)

## Prerequisites

- Schema must be stable (not changing weekly)
- CI integration must be proven (Phase 5)
- Meaningful open-source adoption

## Estimated Scope

Varies. Publishing the spec is small. Growing an ecosystem is ongoing.
